# ðŸ”Š Super 'Blip' ðŸŽ‰

It's a thing. It goes "Blip" a lot. It has a volume slider to de-blippify somewhat.

I threw in some of my favourite UI packages (rebass & styled-system) with the intention of making this thing look pretty at some stage. If it goes beyond "Blip"

## ðŸ¤” What?

Wanted to play with [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) - I've always been interested in the AudioContext / Web Audio API & I've had some luck with [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/oheydrew/sonic-pi) before, so I wanted to see what this was all about.

## ðŸ›  What's Next?

I have some ideas. Auto-generating music, basically. Tone.JS is pretty sweet - has a _ton_ of features to get up and running really quickly. I think this is going to be fun.
